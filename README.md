# car_sellingprice_forecasting_system
This is a python project made using spyder, HTML, Juypter and other conda features. Several different python libraries were used to make this project including scikit-learn and 
numpy with many others. The project uses a kaggle database containing numerous features of Indian cars such as selling price, kms driven, previous owners and much more.
These variables are used by Python to crossreference these values and then find their relevant correlation. Using the appropriate correlation it trains the model adn allows us to 
predict a possible selling priece of teh vehicle using the database. The model is trained using a extension known as ExtraTreesRegressor(). This is a extension of the scikit-learn 
library. The rest of the system is executed using an python file which allows the variables and the trained model to interact.
